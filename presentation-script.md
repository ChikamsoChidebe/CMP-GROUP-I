## SPEAKER 1: INTRODUCTION & DIGITAL PERMANENCE CONCEPT

**[Navigate to Hero Section]**

**Speaker 1:** "Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. I'm [Name], and we are Group I from CMP 103 here at Bingham University. Today, we're going to take you on a journey that will fundamentally change how you think about your digital life.

**[Point to the animated title on screen]**

Look at this statement: 'The Internet Never Forgets.' This isn't just a catchy phrase - it's a digital reality that affects every single one of us in this room. 

**[Click to show statistics]**

Every day, we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data. That's 2.5 followed by 18 zeros. To put that in perspective, 90% of all data in existence was created in just the last two years. But here's the crucial part - once that data exists, it can persist forever.

**[Gesture to floating icons animation]**

Every click, every post, every search, every photo you take creates a permanent digital record. These aren't just temporary actions - they're building blocks of your eternal digital identity.

**[Interactive moment]**

Let me ask you this: How many of you have ever posted something online and then deleted it, thinking it was gone forever? 

**[Pause for hands]**

Keep those hands up, because what I'm about to show you will surprise you. [Name of Speaker 2], can you show us exactly what happens to our data the moment we create it?"

## SPEAKER 2: THE DATA JOURNEY

**[Navigate to Data Storage Section]**

**Speaker 2:** "Thank you, [Speaker 1's name]. I'm [Name], and I'm going to walk you through something most people never see - the incredible journey your data takes the moment you hit 'post' or 'send.'

**[Click on the interactive data flow visualization]**

This isn't theory - this is exactly what's happening right now as we speak. Let me show you by clicking through each step.

**[Click Step 1 - User Creates Data]**

When you post that photo from last night's party, your phone doesn't just send the image. It sends your location, the time, your device information, and even data about who else was tagged. All of this happens automatically.

**[Click Step 2 - ISP Routing]**

Your internet provider - whether it's MTN, Airtel, or Glo here in Nigeria - logs every single website you visit, every file you download, every message you send. They're required by law to keep these records for years.

**[Click Step 3 - Platform Servers]**

Facebook, Instagram, TikTok - they don't just store your post on one server. They immediately create multiple copies across different continents. Why? Because if one server fails, your data must never be lost. It's too valuable.

**[Click Step 4 - Cloud Backup]**

But it doesn't stop there. Your data gets automatically backed up to cloud services. Even if you delete your account, these backup copies can remain for years.

**[Click Step 5 - Search Indexing]**

Google's web crawlers are constantly scanning the internet. If your post was public for even a few minutes, it's likely been indexed and cached. Deleting the original won't remove Google's copy.

**[Click Step 6 - Archive Storage]**

Services like the Wayback Machine take permanent snapshots of web content. They've archived over 735 billion web pages. Once they capture your content, it's preserved forever.

**[Point to the risk assessment panel]**

Notice how the privacy risk increases at each step? By the time your data reaches this point, you've essentially lost control of it forever.

**[Turn to Speaker 3]**

But you might be thinking, 'So what? Who's actually going to find this old data?' [Speaker 3's name], can you show them exactly how easy it is to excavate someone's digital past?"

## SPEAKER 3: DATA RETRIEVAL & GOOGLE SIMULATION

**[Navigate to Google Simulation Section]**

**Speaker 3:** "I'm [Name], and I'm about to demonstrate something that might make you uncomfortable. I'm going to show you how anyone - employers, universities, potential partners, or even strangers - can uncover your digital history in minutes.

**[Click on the search interface]**

This isn't just a regular Google search. This simulates the comprehensive digital investigation process that's happening thousands of times every day. Companies like BeenVerified, Spokeo, and PeopleFinder make millions by aggregating and selling your personal information.

**[Type a sample name and click 'INVESTIGATE']**

Watch what happens when I search for someone. 

**[As the search stages appear]**

See these stages? This is really happening:
- Social media platforms are being scanned
- Cached web pages are being accessed  
- Archived databases are being queried
- Public records are being cross-referenced
- Even deleted content is being recovered

**[When results appear]**

Look at these results. In less than 30 seconds, we've found:
- Social media profiles with personal photos
- Professional information and salary estimates
- Deleted content that was cached by search engines
- Location data from fitness apps
- Data from security breaches
- Public records including home addresses

**[Point to the risk levels]**

Notice the risk levels - Critical, High, Medium, Low. The critical and high-risk items are the ones that could seriously impact your life.

**[Interactive moment]**

Here's what's really scary: This simulation only shows a fraction of what's actually available. Real data brokers have access to thousands more data points about each of us.

**[Click on a high-risk result to expand details]**

Look at this cached dating profile. Even though this person deleted their account, the cached version reveals personal preferences, relationship history, and intimate details. This information could be used for blackmail, harassment, or discrimination.

**[Turn to audience]**

Now, imagine you're applying for your dream job, or trying to get into university, or running for student government. Your potential employer or admissions officer can access all of this information about you in minutes.

**[Turn to Speaker 4]**

But this isn't just theoretical. [Speaker 4's name], can you share some real examples of how this digital permanence has actually destroyed people's lives?"

## SPEAKER 4: REAL CONSEQUENCES & PROTECTION

**[Navigate to Education Section]**

**Speaker 4:** "Thank you, [Speaker 3's name]. I'm [Name], and unfortunately, I have to share some sobering real-world examples of how digital permanence has changed lives forever.

**[Click on case studies]**

These aren't fictional stories - these are real events that happened to real people.

**[Click on 'The Executive's Deleted Tweet']**

A Fortune 500 CEO posted a controversial tweet at 2:47 AM, then deleted it within 15 minutes. But screenshots had already been captured. The result? The company's stock dropped 12%, losing $50 million in value. The CEO was forced to resign within six months.

**[Click on 'The College Admission Scandal']**

A brilliant student with perfect grades had their university admission revoked when admissions officers discovered controversial posts from when they were 14 years old. They lost a $200,000 scholarship and had to attend their backup school.

**[Click on 'The Data Breach Revelation']**

A teacher discovered their personal information was exposed in five different data breaches. Their identity was stolen, resulting in over $15,000 in financial losses and years of credit problems.

**[Show statistics]**

Here are the facts:
- 73% of employers check social media before hiring
- 45% of admissions officers review applicants' posts  
- 92% of data breaches expose information from years ago
- Your content can persist online forever

**[Navigate to Safety Tips section]**

But here's the good news - you're not powerless. There are concrete steps you can take to protect yourself:

**[Click through safety tips]**

1. **Think Before You Post** - Ask yourself: Would I be comfortable with my future employer seeing this in 10 years?

2. **Use Privacy Settings** - Make your profiles private and regularly review who can see your content.

3. **Monitor Your Digital Footprint** - Set up Google alerts for your name and regularly search for yourself online.

4. **Clean Up Old Content** - Go through your old posts and delete anything that doesn't represent who you are today.

5. **Manage Data Collection** - Turn off location tracking and limit how much data companies can collect about you.

6. **Be Selective with Connections** - Only accept friend requests from people you actually know and trust.

**[Navigate to Team Section]**

**[All speakers gather around the team photo]**

**Speaker 4:** "We are Group I from CMP 103 at Bingham University. We researched this topic because we realized that our generation is the first to grow up entirely in the digital age. Our entire lives are documented online, and we wanted to understand the implications.

**[Point to the black and white photo that transitions to color on hover]**

This photo represents our commitment to this research. Just like this image, our digital lives have layers - what we see on the surface, and what's permanently stored beneath.

**[All speakers face the audience]**

**Speaker 1:** "The internet never forgets..."
**Speaker 2:** "Your data travels further than you think..."  
**Speaker 3:** "Anyone can access your digital past..."
**Speaker 4:** "But you can take control of your digital future."

**All together:** "Thank you for your attention. Are there any questions?"
