**[Wait for phones]**

How many posts did you make this week? Raise your hands - 1 post? 5 posts? 10+?

**[Count hands quickly]**

Now, how many of you have EVER deleted a post thinking it was gone forever?

**[Most hands up]**

Keep those hands up! You're about to see why that deleted post might cost you your dream job. [Speaker 2's name], show them where their data REALLY goes!"
